<h1>Delta Intrusion Detection System</h1>
This is my mediocre attempt at a simple IDS, it is a way for me to learn more about Python and security and to make a program that has some sort of actual use, even though it may not be the most efficient. With time I hope to make this an effective IDS and give it as much functionality as any other alternative.

<h1>Usage</h1>
To learn more about the DeltaIDS type:
<code>
python deltaids.py -h
</code>
